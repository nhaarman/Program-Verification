\section{Work distribution}
Because the bulk of the work revolved around figuring out a correct approach for the verification of the sequential and concurrent queues, the main activity for this assignment was discussing the possibilities. Therefore, nearly everything was done as a group and there was not actually much distribution of work. When not working together, we would each fiddle with the code trying out different ways, which would then be shared with the group to benefit from that.
